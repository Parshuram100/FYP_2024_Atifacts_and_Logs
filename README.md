Welcome to the FYP 2024 Artifacts and Logs repository! This repository serves as a collection of key resources, research papers, 
and artifacts related to my Final Year Project for 2024. The project focuses on advanced cybersecurity topics, with a particular emphasis
on AI-based threat detection and analysis using the CIC-2017 dataset and other research on threat detection system.

About the CIC-2017 Dataset
The CIC-2017 dataset is a comprehensive resource that simulates real-world network traffic scenarios, including various attack patterns like DDoS, brute force, and phishing. 
It is widely used for developing and testing intrusion detection systems and AI-based cybersecurity solutions.

Purpose
This repository is intended to:

1. Share key resources and findings from the FYP 2024 project.
2. Provide insights into the use of AI for enhancing threat detection systems.
3. Serve as a knowledge base for cybersecurity enthusiasts and researchers.

Contributions Feel free to explore the repository and share feedback or suggestions. For any inquiries, contact me via GitHub.
